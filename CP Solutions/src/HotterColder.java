/*"Hotter" ->new point is closer than the last point,

   "Colder" -> new point is farther away than the last point,

   "Same" -> two points are equally close.

   Output -> area of  possible positions after each point.

   For two points A, B. If the distance from a point P-A < P-B, then P must be on the side of A, B perpendicular to A, and vice versa.
   P-A and P-B are equal, then P must be on the perpendicular line between A and B.
   answer is cutting polygon, ie.. finding the intersection of the polygon and the half plane.
